## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) 8 or higher
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for building the project

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

##  Docker Configuration

1. As requested, there are two Docker files: Dockerfile.mysql that create a mysql container with the hospital database already created and the user and password data (to be changed for the real ones)
2. These two Docker files are build and images are run with the console command: docker-compose up that execute the script inside the document: docker-compose.yml
3. Once the containers are up, the system is ready to make tests through a framework like postman. Use this o similar frameworks to create a database with doctors, patients and rooms as stated in the Endpoints section.
4. In the Dockerfile.maven the testing is blocked as some tests not modified by me are not passing. To activate the maven testing, you should eliminate the -Dskiptest modifier in line xx of Dockerfile.maven

## Endpoints

1. As requested, I just created the "createAppointment" method inside the Appointment controller
2. the rest of endpoints are working well as you can test with postman

## Test

1. I was assigned two tasks: Create entities test for the entities inside the EntityUnitTest.java (Doctor,Patient and Room) and Create Test for each of these entities Controllers inside the EntityControllerUnitTest.java
2. All these tests are passed when running the IDE utility
